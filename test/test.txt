### Convert HTML to PDF with Pandoc

You can run the following command to convert an HTML file to PDF:

```bash
pandoc your-file.html -o your-file.pdf
```

This command tells Pandoc to take the `your-file.html` file as input and produce a PDF (`your-file.pdf`) as output.

### Styling the PDF

If you'd like to include CSS styling, you can do so with the `--css` flag:

```bash
pandoc your-file.html --css=styles.css -o your-file.pdf
```

This will apply the styles from `styles.css` to the PDF.

### Additional Options

You can add more command-line options to customize your output. For example, you can specify a different page size with the `-V` flag like this:

```bash
pandoc your-file.html -V papersize:a4paper -o your-file.pdf
```

This sets the paper size to A4.

So yes, Pandoc can easily handle HTML to PDF conversions, and it gives you a lot of flexibility in how you produce the final PDF. Want to dive deeper into any of these aspects?
